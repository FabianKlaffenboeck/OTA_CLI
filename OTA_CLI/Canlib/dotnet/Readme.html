<h1>Kvaser C# Wrapper for CANlib</h1>

<p>The Kvaser C# wrapper for CANlib exists in two different versions, one is targeting .NET Standard 2.0 and the other is targeting .NET 6.0. This document describes the differences between the two versions and when to use which.</p>

<h2>Using NuGet Package Manager</h2>
<p>In this folder you will find NuGet package files, one for each wrapper. These packages can be used in your project using the NuGet Package Manager. To do this you need to add this folder as a NuGet package source for your project by adding a nuget.config file. Here is an example of a nuget.config file:</p>

<p><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;packageSources&gt;
        &lt;clear /&gt;    
        &lt;add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" /&gt;
        &lt;add key="canlib" value="[THE PATH TO THIS FOLDER EITHER ABSOLUT OR RELATIVE TO YOUR PROJECT]" /&gt;
    &lt;/packageSources&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></p>

<p>If you are using this approach then the NuGet Package Manager will make sure that you are using the correct version of the wrapper, .NET Standard 2.0 or .NET 6.0.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to use the NuGet Package Manager:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a nuget.config file to your projects root folder</li>
  <li>Make sure that the canlib source is pointing to the folder that includes the CANlib NuGet package files</li>
  <li>Open you project in Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Open the Solution Explorer</li>
  <li>Locate the Dependencies folder underneath your project, right-click on the folder and select 'Manage NuGet Packages'</li>
  <li>Click on Browse</li>
  <li>Make sure the 'Package source' is set to 'All' or 'canlib'</li>
  <li>Select the wrapper you want to use in your project and click Install</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using Assembly File References</h2>
<p>Another alternative is to add the Kvaser C# wrapper assemblies as project references. In that case you must make sure to pick the correct version. These assemblies are found in sub-folders net6.0 respectively netstandard2.0.</p>

<p>If your project is targeting .NET 6.0 or higher, then you should reference the assemblies in sub-folder net6.0. This is the preferred version to use. The net6.0 assemblies include support for both Windows and Linux whilst the netstandard2.0 assemblies only supports Windows.</p>

<p>If your project is targeting any version below .NET 6.0, i.e. .NET Framework 4.x, .NET Core 2.x-3.x or .NET 5.x, then you should reference the assemblies in sub-folder netstandard2.0.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to use the file references:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open you project in Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Open the Solution Explorer</li>
  <li>Locate the Dependencies folder below your project, right-click on the folder and select 'Add Project Reference'</li>
  <li>Click on Browse in the left tree view and then on the Browse button</li>
  <li>Browse to the correct folder, net6.0 or netstandard2.0, select the assembly you want to use and click Add</li>
  <li>Click on OK</li>
</ol>
